As a developer, one of the first steps before attempting to do any work is to create a good development environment. This involves choosing a set of tools that we will spend most of our time using. Therefore, I compiled a list of the tools that I use or have used on my daily routine.

Regarding operating systems, I started out with the initial Windows versions, but moved to the GNU/Linux ecosystem. I have distro-hopped between some distributions such as [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/), [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [CrunchBang](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/) (now called BunsenLabs) and [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/). 
I have settled with the [Antergos](https://antergos.com/) distro, which is an ArchLinux based distribution. So far, it has not given me much trouble and I can get the cool features expected from a rolling release distribution, i.e., a distro with constant, small and frequent updates, with a great level of customization and lightweight on system resources. My current setup includes the light Xfce Desktop environment and the fancy Numix theme suit. This choice reflects my preference for choosing functionality over aesthetics and graphics. For mobile devices, I stick with the Android ecosystem.

I use [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator) as my terminal of choice and Bash as the command-line shell. Filezila is my choice for downloading files over SFTP from remote servers. In terms of editing, I use the [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) editor for simple and quick edits. For general development, I trust in the amazing Jetbrains development tools. My most used tools are [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm)/[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea), for server-side languages such as Python or Java, [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for dealing with web technologies and [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) for dealing with databases. In the past I used other IDES, suchas Eclipse, Netbeans or CodeBlocks. My control version of choice is [git](https://git-scm.com/). If I need to edit LaTeX files, I use the [gummi](https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi) editor. 

My browsing experience takes a big chunk of time. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) and [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium) are my web browsers of choice. For Firefox, I make use of great add-ons such as [Octotree](https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree) which lets me visualize the source code tree of Github and Gitlab projects and [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/) to rewrite the appearance of some websites. [WebDeveloper](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/) and [YSlow](developer.yahoo.com/yslow) are also great tools that help your web development.
